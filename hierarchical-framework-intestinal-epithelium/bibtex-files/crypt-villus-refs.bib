  abstract  = "``Exploratory'' and ``confirmatory'' data analysis can both be
               viewed as methods for comparing observed data to what would be
               obtained under an implicit or explicit statistical model. For
               example, many of Tukey's methods can be interpreted as checks
               against hypothetical linear models and Poisson distributions. In
               more complex situations, Bayesian methods can be useful for
               constructing reference distributions for various plots that are
               useful in exploratory data analysis. This article proposes an
               approach to unify exploratory data analysis with more formal
               statistical methods based on probability models. These ideas are
               developed in the context of examples from fields including
               psychology, medicine, and social science.",

  abstract = "We survey latent variable models for solving data-analysis
              problems. A latent variable model is a probabilistic model that
              encodes hidden patterns in the data. We uncover these patterns
              from their conditional distribution and use them to summarize
              data and form predictions. Latent variable models are important
              in many fields, including computational biology, natural language
              processing, and social network analysis. Our perspective is that
              models are developed iteratively: We build a model, use it to
              analyze data, assess how it succeeds and fails, revise it, and
              repeat. We describe how new research has transformed these
              essential activities. First, we describe probabilistic graphical
              models, a language for formulating latent variable models.
              Second, we describe mean field variational inference, a generic
              algorithm for approximating conditional distributions. Third, we
              describe how to use our analyses to solve problems: exploring the

              improved models.",

               across a wide variety of scientific disciplines to describe and
               predict spatially explicit processes that evolve over time.
               Although descriptive models that approach this problem from the
               second-order (covariance) perspective are important, many
               real-world processes are dynamic, and it can be more efficient
               in such cases to characterize the associated spatio-temporal
               dependence by the use of dynamical models. The challenge with
               the specification of such dynamical models has been related to
               the curse of dimensionality and the specification of realistic
               dependence structures. Even in fairly simple linear/Gaussian
               settings, spatio-temporal statistical models are often over
               parameterized. This problem is compounded when the
               spatio-temporal dynamical processes are nonlinear or
               multivariate. Hierarchical models have proven invaluable in
               their ability to deal to some extent with this issue by allowing
               dependency among groups of parameters and science-based
               parameterizations. Such models are best considered from a
               Bayesian perspective, with associated computational challenges.

              Hierarchical {B}ayes and empirical {B}ayes",

  abstract = "A common way to account for uncertainty in inverse problems is to
              apply Bayes' rule and obtain a posterior distribution of the
              quantities of interest given a set of measurements. A
              conventional Bayesian treatment, however, requires assuming
              specific values for parameters of the prior distribution and of
              the distribution of the measurement errors (e.g., the standard
              deviation of the errors). In practice, these parameters are often
              poorly known a priori, and choosing a particular value is often
              problematic. Moreover, the posterior uncertainty is computed
              assuming that these parameters are fixed; if they are not well
              known a priori, the posterior uncertainties have dubious
              value.This paper describes extensions to the conventional
              Bayesian treatment that assign uncertainty to the parameters
              defining the prior distribution and the distribution of the
              measurement errors. These extensions are known in the statistical
              literature as ``empirical Bayes'' and ``hierarchical Bayes.'' We
              demonstrate the practical application of these approaches to a
              simple linear inverse problem: using seismic traveltimes measured
              by a receiver in a well to infer compressional wave slowness in a
              1D earth model. These procedures do not require choosing fixed
              values for poorly known parameters and, at most, need a realistic
              range (e.g., a minimum and maximum value for the standard
              deviation of the measurement errors). Inversion is thus made
              easier for general users, who are not required to set parameters
              they know little about.",

                 in the process(es) that generated the data. However,
                 accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since
                 ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or
                 process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty
                 modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet
                 analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling
                 design, in model specification, in parameters governing the
                 specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only
                 then can we be confident in the scientific inferences and
                 forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics
                 provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of
                 uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the
                 hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This
                 approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples
                 (both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature
                 illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article,
                 we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods,

                 ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for
                 discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties
                 lie. Our thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a
                 powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the

              of tightly adherent cells, such as an epithelial monolayer. Each
              cell occupies a bounded region, defined by the location of its
              endpoints, has both elastic and viscous mechanical properties and
              is subject to drag generated by adhesion to the substrate.
              Differential-algebraic equations governing the evolution of the
              system are obtained from energy considerations. This IBM is then
              approximated by continuum models (systems of partial differential
              equations) in the limit of a large number of cells, N, when the
              cell parameters vary slowly in space or are spatially periodic
              (and so may be heterogeneous, with substantial variation between
              adjacent cells). For spatially periodic cell properties with
              significant cell viscosity, the relationship between the mean
              cell pressure and length for the continuum model is found to be
              history dependent. Terms involving convective derivatives, not
              normally included in continuum tissue models, are identified. The
              specific problem of the expansion of an aggregate of cells
              through cell growth (but without division) is considered in
              detail, including the long-time and slow-growth-rate limits. When
              the parameters of neighbouring cells vary slowly in space, the
              O(1/N2) error in the continuum approximation enables this
              approach to be used even for modest values of N. In the spatially
              periodic case, the neglected terms are found to be O(1/N). The

                 the role of signals in the environment in the control of cell
                 motility and directional guidance. In many cases, especially
                 in developmental biology, growth of the domain also plays a
                 large role in the distribution of cells and, in some cases,
                 cell or signal distribution may actually drive domain growth.
                 There is an almost ubiquitous use of partial differential
                 equations (PDEs) for modelling the time evolution of cellular
                 density and environmental cues. In the last 20 years, a lot of
                 attention has been devoted to connecting macroscopic PDEs with
                 more detailed microscopic models of cellular motility,
                 including models of directional sensing and signal
                 transduction pathways. However, domain growth is largely
                 omitted in the literature. In this paper, individual-based
                 models describing cell movement and domain growth are studied,

  abstract    = "There is much interest in building deterministic continuum
                 models from discrete agent-based models governed by local
                 stochastic rules where an agent represents a biological cell.
                 In developmental biology, cells are able to move and undergo
                 cell division on and within growing tissues. A growing tissue
                 is itself made up of cells which undergo cell division,
                 thereby providing a significant transport mechanism for other
                 cells within it. We develop a discrete agent-based model where
                 domain agents represent tissue cells. Each agent has the
                 ability to undergo a proliferation event whereby an additional
                 domain agent is incorporated into the lattice. If a
                 probability distribution describes the waiting times between
                 proliferation events for an individual agent, then the total
                 length of the domain is a random variable. The average
                 behavior of these stochastically proliferating agents defining
                 the growing lattice is determined in terms of a Fokker-Planck
                 equation, with an advection and diffusion term. The diffusion
                 term differs from the one obtained Landman and Binder [J.
                 Theor. Biol. 259, 541 (2009)] when the rate of growth of the
                 domain is specified, but the choice of agents is random. This
                 discrepancy is reconciled by determining a discrete-time
                 master equation for this process and an associated asymmetric
                 nonexclusion random walk, together with consideration of
                 synchronous and asynchronous updating schemes. All theoretical
                 results are confirmed with numerical simulations. This study
                 furthers our understanding of the relationship between
                 agent-based rules, their implementation, and their associated
                 partial differential equations. Since tissue growth is a
                 significant cellular transport mechanism during embryonic
                 growth, it is important to use the correct partial
                 differential equation description when combining with other

                 in mathematical biology. However, the recent rapid increase in
                 the number of modeling methodologies being used to describe
                 cell populations has raised a number of interesting questions.
                 For example, at the cellular scale, how can the appropriate
                 discrete cell-level model be identified in a given context?
                 Additionally, how can the many phenomenological assumptions
                 used in the derivation of models at the continuum scale be
                 related to individual cell behavior? In order to begin to
                 address such questions, we consider a discrete one-dimensional
                 cell-based model in which cells are assumed to interact via
                 linear springs. From the discrete equations of motion, the
                 continuous Rouse [P. E. Rouse, J. Chem. Phys. 21, 1272 (1953)]
                 model is obtained. This formalism readily allows the
                 definition of a cell number density for which a nonlinear
                 ``fast'' diffusion equation is derived. Excellent agreement is
                 demonstrated between the continuum and discrete models.
                 Subsequently, via the incorporation of cell division, we
                 demonstrate that the derived nonlinear diffusion model is
                 robust to the inclusion of more realistic biological detail.
                 In the limit of stiff springs, where cells can be considered
                 to be incompressible, we show that cell velocity can be
                 directly related to cell production. This assumption is
                 frequently made in the literature but our derivation places
                 limits on its validity. Finally, the model is compared with a
                 model of a similar form recently derived for a different
                 discrete cell-based model and it is shown how the different
                 diffusion coefficients can be understood in terms of the
                 underlying assumptions about cell behavior in the respective
                 discrete models.",

              for a given discrete model and a given coupling of discrete and
              continuum degrees of freedom, the continuum should be defined
              uniquely, (ii) the continuum is isotropic, and (iii) boundary
              conditions are derived consistently with the energy functional
              and the equations of motion of the continuum. Firstly, a
              comparison is made between two continualisation methods, namely
              based on the equations of motion and on the energy functional.
              They are shown to give identical results. Secondly, the issue of
              isotropy is addressed. A new approach is developed in which two,
              rather than one, layers of neighbouring particles are considered.
              Finally, the formulation and interpretation of boundary
              conditions is treated. By means of the Hamilton--Ostrogradsky

                   avoid. Here, the story of closure is told in such a way that
                   one should enduringly forget any improper undertone of
                   ``uncontrolled approximation'' or ``necessary evil'' which
                   might arise, for example, in reducing a diffusion equation
                   in configuration space to moment equations. In its widest
                   sense, closure is associated with the search for
                   self-contained levels of description on which time-evolution
                   equations can be formulated in a closed, or autonomous,
                   form. Proper closure requires the identification of the
                   relevant structural variables participating in the dominant
                   processes in a system of interest, and closure hence is
                   synonymous with focusing on the essence of a problem and
                   consequently with deep understanding. The derivation of
                   closed equations may or may not be accompanied by the
                   elimination of fast processes in favor of dissipation. As a
                   general requirement, any closed set of evolution equations
                   should be thermodynamically admissible. Thermodynamic
                   admissibility comprises much more than the second law of
                   thermodynamics, most notably, a clear separation of
                   reversible and irreversible effects and a profound geometric
                   structure of the reversible terms as a hallmark of
                   reversibility. We discuss some implications of the intimate
                   relationship between nonequilibrium thermodynamics and the
                   principles of closure for rheology, and we illustrate the
                   abstract ideas for the rod model of liquid crystal polymers,
                   bead-spring models of dilute polymer solutions, and the

                 statistical analysis. Systems with near-chaotic dynamics are

                 endogenous dynamic processes plus demographic and
                 environmental process noise, and are only observable with
                 error. Their sensitivity to history means that minute changes
                 in the driving noise realization, or the system parameters,
                 will cause drastic changes in the system trajectory. This
                 sensitivity is inherited and amplified by the joint
                 probability density of the observable data and the process
                 noise, rendering it useless as the basis for obtaining
                 measures of statistical fit. Because the joint density is the
                 basis for the fit measures used by all conventional
                 statistical methods, this is a major theoretical shortcoming.
                 The inability to make well-founded statistical inferences
                 about biological dynamic models in the chaotic and
                 near-chaotic regimes, other than on an ad hoc basis, leaves
                 dynamic theory without the methods of quantitative validation
                 that are essential tools in the rest of biological science.
                 Here I show that this impasse can be resolved in a simple and
                 general manner, using a method that requires only the ability
                 to simulate the observed data on a system from the dynamic
                 model about which inferences are required. The raw data series
                 are reduced to phase-insensitive summary statistics,
                 quantifying local dynamic structure and the distribution of
                 observations. Simulation is used to obtain the mean and the
                 covariance matrix of the statistics, given model parameters,
                 allowing the construction of a 'synthetic likelihood' that
                 assesses model fit. This likelihood can be explored using a
                 straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, but one
                 further post-processing step returns pure likelihood-based
                 inference. I apply the method to establish the dynamic nature

                 likelihood function, depending instead on simulation of sample
                 data sets from the model. In this paper we show that under the
                 assumption of the existence of a uniform additive model error

                 understood, and should guide the choice of metric and
                 tolerance in future work. ABC algorithms can be generalized by
                 replacing the 0-1 cut-off with an acceptance probability that
                 varies with the distance of the simulated data from the

                 likelihood of the data under complex stochastic models is
                 often analytically or numerically intractable in many areas of
                 sciences. This makes it even more important to simultaneously
                 investigate the adequacy of these models-in absolute terms,
                 against the data, rather than relative to the performance of
                 other models-but no such procedure has been formally discussed
                 when the likelihood is intractable. We provide a statistical
                 interpretation to current developments in likelihood-free

                   a parametrized mechanism which specifies how data are

                   are of interest and allow the generative process to be very
                   general; it may be a noisy nonlinear dynamical system with

                   Several likelihood-free inference methods have been proposed
                   which share the basic idea of identifying the parameters by
                   finding values for which the discrepancy between simulated

                   to the need to repeatedly simulate data sets and the lack of
                   knowledge about how the parameters affect the discrepancy.

                   of the discrepancy with optimization to facilitate
                   likelihood-free inference. The strategy is implemented using
                   Bayesian optimization and is shown to accelerate the

               are the traditional choice to test scientific theories when
               observations, processes or boundary conditions are subject to
               stochasticity. Many important systems in ecology and biology,
               however, are difficult to capture with statistical models.
               Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were
               hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood
               functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it
               is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical

                 power of mathematical modeling by considering two key
                 questions about the cell population dynamics in the colonic
                 crypt. We ask: how can a model describe both homeostasis and
                 unregulated growth in tumorigenesis; and to which parameters
                 in the system is the model most sensitive? In order to address
                 these questions, we discuss what type of modeling approach is
                 most appropriate in the crypt. We use the model to argue why
                 tumorigenesis is observed to occur in stages with long lag
                 phases between periods of rapid growth, and we identify the
                 key parameters.",

              recently obtained studying the detachment force of single
              adhesion bonds in a multiphase model developed in the framework
              of mixture theory. In order to do that the microscopic
              information is upscaled to the macroscopic level to describe the
              dependence of some crucial terms appearing in the PDE model on
              the sub-cellular dynamics involving, for instance, the density of
              bonds on the membrane, the probability of bond rupture and the
              rate of bond formation. In fact, adhesion phenomena influence
              both the interaction forces among the constituents of the
              mixtures and the constitutive equation for the stress of the
              cellular components. Studying the former terms a relationship
              between interaction forces and relative velocity is found. The
              dynamics presents a behavior resembling the transition from
              epithelial to mesenchymal cells or from mesenchymal to ameboid
              motion, though the chemical cues triggering such transitions are

              decomposing in a multiplicative way the deformation gradient of
              the cellular constituent distinguishing the contributions due to

               intricate spatio-temporal processes, interacting on a wide
               variety of scales. There is increasingly vast amounts of data
               for such processes from geographical information systems, remote
               sensing platforms, monitoring networks, and computer models. In
               addition, often there is a great variety of scientific knowledge
               available for such systems, from partial differential equations
               based on first principles to panel surveys. It is argued that it
               is not generally adequate to consider such processes from a
               joint perspective. Instead, the processes often must be
               considered as a coherently linked system of conditional models.
               This paper provides a brief overview of hierarchical approaches
               applied to environmental processes. The key elements of such
               models can be considered in three general stages, the data
               stage, process stage, and parameter stage. In each stage,
               complicated dependence structure is mitigated by conditioning.
               For example, the data stage can incorporate measurement errors
               as well as multiple datasets with varying supports. The process
               and parameter stages can allow spatial and spatio-temporal
               processes as well as the direct inclusion of scientific
               knowledge. The paper concludes with a discussion of some
               outstanding problems in hierarchical modelling of environmental
               systems, including the need for new collaboration approaches.

  abstract = "A common way to account for uncertainty in inverse problems is to
              apply Bayes' rule and obtain a posterior distribution of the
              quantities of interest given a set of measurements. A
              conventional Bayesian treatment, however, requires assuming
              specific values for parameters of the prior distribution and of
              the distribution of the measurement errors (e.g., the standard
              deviation of the errors). In practice, these parameters are often
              poorly known a priori, and choosing a particular value is often
              problematic. Moreover, the posterior uncertainty is computed
              assuming that these parameters are fixed; if they are not well
              known a priori, the posterior uncertainties have dubious
              value.This paper describes extensions to the conventional
              Bayesian treatment that assign uncertainty to the parameters
              defining the prior distribution and the distribution of the
              measurement errors. These extensions are known in the statistical
              literature as ``empirical Bayes'' and ``hierarchical Bayes.'' We
              demonstrate the practical application of these approaches to a
              simple linear inverse problem: using seismic traveltimes measured
              by a receiver in a well to infer compressional wave slowness in a
              1D earth model. These procedures do not require choosing fixed
              values for poorly known parameters and, at most, need a realistic
              range (e.g., a minimum and maximum value for the standard
              deviation of the measurement errors). Inversion is thus made
              easier for general users, who are not required to set parameters
              they know little about.",

                 ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or
                 process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty
                 modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet
                 analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling
                 design, in model specification, in parameters governing the
                 specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only
                 then can we be confident in the scientific inferences and
                 forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics
                 provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of

                 rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise
                 and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that
                 the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not
                 actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord
                 much better with sophisticated forms of
                 hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by
                 prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial
                 aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall
                 outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on
                 the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and
                 also on our experience of applied work in social science.
                 Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy

                 (BrdU) or deuterated glucose ((2)H-glucose). To estimate the
                 turnover rate from such measurements one has to fit a
                 particular mathematical model to the data. The biological
                 assumptions underlying various models developed for this
                 purpose are controversial. Here, we fit a series of different
                 models to BrdU data on CD4(+) T cells from SIV(-) and SIV(+)
                 rhesus macaques. We first show that the parameter estimates
                 obtained using these models depend strongly on the details of
                 the model. To resolve this lack of generality we introduce a
                 new parameter for each model, the 'average turnover rate',
                 defined as the cellular death rate averaged over all

              cell populations in labeling experiments. It is especially
              tailored to the technique of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), which is
              taken up by dividing cells and thus accumulates with increasing
              division number during uplabeling. The study of the evolving
              label intensities of BrdU labeled cell populations is aimed at
              quantifying proliferation properties such as division and death
              rates. RESULTS: In contrast to existing models, our model
              considers a labeling efficacy that follows a distribution, rather
              than a uniform value. It thereby allows to account for noise as
              well as possibly space-dependent heterogeneity in the effective
              label uptake of the individual cells in a population.
              Furthermore, it enables more informative comparison with
              experimental data: The population-level label distribution is
              provided as a model output, thereby increasing the information
              content compared to existing models that give the fraction of
              labeled cells or the mean label intensity. CONCLUSION: The
              presented model is to our knowledge the first one that predicts
              the full label distribution for BrdU labeling experiments. Thus,
              it can exploit more information, namely the full intensity
              distribution, from labeling measurements, and thereby opens up
              new quantitative insights into cell proliferation.",

                 and population dynamics play an essential role. Due to this
                 ubiquity, a multitude of mathematical models has been
                 developed to describe these processes. While the simplest
                 models only consider the size of the overall populations,
                 others take division numbers and labeling of the cells into
                 account. In this work, we present a modeling and computational
                 framework for proliferating cell populations undergoing
                 symmetric cell division, which incorporates both the discrete
                 division number and continuous label dynamics. Thus, it allows
                 for the consideration of division number-dependent parameters
                 as well as the direct comparison of the model prediction with
                 labeling experiments, e.g., performed with Carboxyfluorescein
                 succinimidyl ester (CFSE), and can be shown to be a
                 generalization of most existing models used to describe these
                 data. We prove that under mild assumptions the resulting
                 system of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) can be
                 decomposed into a system of ordinary differential equations
                 (ODEs) and a set of decoupled PDEs, which drastically reduces
                 the computational effort for simulating the model.
                 Furthermore, the PDEs are solved analytically and the ODE
                 system is truncated, which allows for the prediction of the
                 label distribution of complex systems using a low-dimensional
                 system of ODEs. In addition to modeling the label dynamics, we

                 detect cell division, and several mathematical models have
                 been proposed to estimate proliferation and death rates of
                 lymphocytes from BrdU labelling and de-labelling curves. One
                 problem in interpreting BrdU data is explaining the
                 de-labelling curves. Because shortly after label withdrawal,
                 BrdU(+) cells are expected to divide into BrdU(+) daughter
                 cells, one would expect a flat down-slope. As for many cell
                 types, the fraction of BrdU(+) cells decreases during
                 de-labelling, previous mathematical models had to make
                 debatable assumptions to be able to account for the data. We
                 develop a mechanistic model tracking the number of divisions
                 that each cell has undergone in the presence and absence of
                 BrdU, and allow cells to accumulate and dilute their BrdU
                 content. From the same mechanistic model, one can naturally
                 derive expressions for the mean BrdU content (MBC) of all
                 cells, or the MBC of the BrdU(+) subset, which is related to
                 the mean fluorescence intensity of BrdU that can be measured
                 in experiments. The model is extended to include
                 subpopulations with different rates of division and death
                 (i.e. kinetic heterogeneity). We fit the extended model to

                 simian immunodeficiency virus-infected and uninfected
                 macaques, and find that the model describes the data with at
                 least the same quality as previous models. Because the same
                 model predicts a modest decline in the MBC of BrdU(+) cells,
                 which is consistent with experimental observations, BrdU
                 dilution seems a natural explanation for the observed

                 mitosis leads to an increase in the mitotic index from 0.06 to
                 0.34 at crypt positions 8-12. Surprisingly, the leading edge
                 of the position-related mitotic index distribution moves to
                 higher crypt positions although cell division was stopped. In
                 addition, the vertical clustering of mitotic figures in
                 sections was recorded. The data were examined using a
                 previously described computer crypt model. We conclude: the
                 average mitotic phase duration is about 0.7 h (40 min) and
                 varies little with cell position; the geometrical correction
                 factor for overscoring mitoses in crypt sections is about
                 0.6-0.7 and adjacent cell columns can merge. Lateral cell
                 displacement after mitosis, as predicted in a previous model
                 analysis, would be a mechanism to counteract other forces that
                 tend to reduce the crypt circumference. In the normal steady
                 state merging and expansion processes would just balance each
                 other. This would not follow if one mechanism was blocked.
                 Thus we propose a new concept in which the crypt geometry
                 would be dynamically determined by cell proliferative activity
                 in connection with lateral positioning of new cells on one

              been studied and modelled mathematically under steady-state
              conditions. A great deal of information is available for this
              system, e.g. cell cycle times, S phase durations, the rate of
              daily cell production, the Paneth cell distribution etc. The
              purpose of the present work was to consider simultaneously as
              much of these data as possible and to formulate a model based
              upon the behaviour of individual cells which adequately accounted
              for them. A simple mathematical representation of the crypt has
              been developed. This consists of sixteen stem cells per crypt (TC
              = 16 hr, TS = 9 hr), and four subsequent transit cell divisions
              (TC = 11 to 12 hr, TS = 8 hr) before maturation. Experimental
              data considered to test the modelling were LI and data on the
              number of vertical runs of similarly labelled cells. All data
              were obtained from the ileum after 25 microCi [3H]TdR given at
              09:00 hours. A number of alternative assumptions have been
              considered and either accepted or rejected. Two alternative model
              concepts of cell displacement explain the data equally well. One
              is dependent upon strong local cell generation age determinance
              while the other could accommodate any weak local cell
              displacement process in conjunction with an environmental cut-off
              determinant at the middle of the crypt. Both models provide new
              interpretations of the data, e.g. certain rates of lateral cell
              exchange between neighbouring columns (250 to 350 per crypt per
              day out of a total of 420 cell divisions per day) can be
              concluded from run data, while LI data provide information about
              the mechanisms involved in maintaining a position-related age

                 regular renewal of the epithelium, and the continued upward
                 movement of cells is a key characteristic of healthy crypt
                 dynamics. However, the driving force behind this migration is
                 unknown. Possibilities include mitotic pressure, active
                 movement driven by motility cues, or negative pressure arising
                 from cell loss at the crypt collar. It is possible that a
                 combination of factors together coordinate migration. Here,
                 three different computational models are used to provide
                 insight into the mechanisms that underpin cell movement in the
                 crypt, by examining the consequence of eliminating cell
                 division on cell movement. Computational simulations agree
                 with existing experimental results, confirming that migration
                 can continue in the absence of mitosis. Importantly, however,
                 simulations allow us to infer mechanisms that are sufficient
                 to generate cell movement, which is not possible through
                 experimental observation alone. The results produced by the
                 three models agree and suggest that cell loss due to apoptosis
                 and extrusion at the crypt collar relieves cell compression
                 below, allowing cells to expand and move upwards. This finding

                 amount of experimental data on which the models are
                 parameterized is often limited, these models exhibit large
                 uncertainty in both parameters and predictions. Statistical
                 methods can be used to select experiments that will reduce
                 such uncertainty in an optimal manner. However, existing
                 methods for optimal experiment design (OED) rely on
                 assumptions that are inappropriate when data are scarce

                 novel method to perform OED for models that cope with large
                 parameter uncertainty. We employ a Bayesian approach involving
                 importance sampling of the posterior predictive distribution
