This is now a repo only for:

The full manuscript, author information and copyright information can found here: http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/25/072561. (The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder. It is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.)

Preserving this link so it still works. From now on I'll try to give each open manuscript its own repo.
